# Website to visualise various search/pathfinding algorithms
Check it out at <https://awesomealex1.github.io/Search/>

Currently supports: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, A* Search (Diagonal and not diagonal - only configurable in source code)

## Ideas for further improvement
Add Toggle for wether diagonal search is allowed.

Add Toggle for wether walls can be crossed diagonally.

Different terrains with different movement speeds.

More algorithms of course.
